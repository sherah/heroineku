title: Starting Over
---

Heroineku was previously connected to a now-defunct tumblr blogging the UX-centered career journey I began in early 2012, but I have decided to disconnect it from those old posts. I'm looking to breathe new life into this project and begin more earnest and focused work looking forward to 2015.

Expect to see more about social issues, specific technical challenges I'm working with at the Wikimedia Foundation, project updates, and the like.

Cheers!
