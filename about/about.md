<a href="http://heroineku.com">Heroineku</a> is a made-up name.
===============================================================

In August 2013, I discovered the awesome Chrome extension "<a href="https://github.com/DanielleSucher/Jailbreak-the-Patriarchy/issues">Jailbreak the Patriarchy</a>," created by <a href="http://www.daniellesucher.com/2011/11/jailbreak-the-patriarchy-my-first-chrome-extension/">Danielle Sucher</a>, which will "swap gendered pronouns and other terms throughout web browsing." I use it sometimes for amusement.

One of the more amusing swap-outs was seeing "<a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>" changed into "Heroineku." That's where this site got its name.

I've been playing with the format of this site for a while now. I hope it becomes a place where I deposit tutorials, write essays, and display whatever I'm working on. It's just kinda my nerd outlet.

Some Of The Techishly Things I Nerd Out Upon
